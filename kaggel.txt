We'll build what's known as a random forest model. This model is constructed of several "trees" (there are three trees in the picture below, but we'll construct 100!) that will individually consider each passenger's data and vote on whether the individual survived. Then, the random forest model makes a democratic decision: the outcome with the most votes wins!
