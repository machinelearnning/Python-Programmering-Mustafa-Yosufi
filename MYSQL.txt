MYSQL
     MySQL is one of the most popular databases
     Create Connection
     Start by creating a connection to the database.
    
Creating a Database
     mycursor = mydb.cursor()
     ("CREATE DATABASE mydatabase")
     mycursor.execute("SHOW DATABASES")
     for x in mycursor:
        print(x)


Creating a Table
     To create a table in MySQL, use the "CREATE TABLE" statement.'
     mycursor.execute("CREATE TABLE customers (name VARCHAR(255), address VARCHAR(255))")

     Primary Key
     When creating a table, you should also create a column with a unique key for each record.
     This can be done by defining a PRIMARY KEY.
     ex: mycursor.execute("CREATE TABLE customers (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), address VARCHAR(255))")
     if the table allredy exist: mycursor.execute("ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY")

Insert Into Table
     To fill a table in MySQL, use the "INSERT INTO" statement.

     sql = "INSERT INTO customers (name, address) VALUES (%s, %s)"
     val = ("John", "Highway 21")
     mycursor.execute(sql, val)
     mydb.commit()
     print(mycursor.rowcount, "record inserted.")

     Insert Multiple Rows
     use: mycursor.executemany(sql, val) instead of mycursor.execute(sql, val)
  
     Get Inserted ID
     You can get the id of the row you just inserted by asking the cursor object.
     print("1 record inserted, ID:", mycursor.lastrowid)

Select From a Table
     To select from a table in MySQL, use the "SELECT" statement:
     mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")
     myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
     for x in myresult:
        print(x)
     We use the fetchall() method, which fetches all rows from the last executed statement.

     Selecting Columns
     mycursor.execute("SELECT name, address FROM customers")
     myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
  
     first rows
     If you are only interested in one row, you can use the fetchone() method.
     mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")
     myresult = mycursor.fetchone()
     print(myresult)

MySQL Where
     When selecting records from a table, you can filter the selection by using the "WHERE" statement
     sql = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address ='Park Lane 38'"
     mycursor.execute(sql)
     myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
     for x in myresult:
         print(x)

     Wildcard Characters
     sql = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address LIKE '%way%'"

     Prevent SQL Injection
     sql = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address = %s"
     adr = ("Yellow Garden 2", )
     mycursor.execute(sql, adr)

MySQL Order By
     Use the ORDER BY statement to sort the result in ascending(stigande)or descending(fallande) order.

     sql = "SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY name"
     mycursor.execute(sql)
     myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
     for x in myresult:
        print(x)

    sql = "SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY name DESC"

MySQL Delete From By
    You can delete records from an existing table by using the "DELETE FROM" statement:

    sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = 'Mountain 21'"
    mycursor.execute(sql)
    mydb.commit()

    Prevent SQL Injection
    sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = %s"
    adr = ("Yellow Garden 2", )

MySQL Drop Table
    You can delete an existing table by using the "DROP TABLE" statement:
    sql = "DROP TABLE customers"
    mycursor.execute(sql)

    Drop Only if Exist
    sql = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers"
    mycursor.execute(sql)
